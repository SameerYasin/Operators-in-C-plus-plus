# Aim:
To study and implement Operators in C++

# Software Required:
Visual Studio Code

# Theory:
An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C++ is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators −

Arithmetic Operators

Relational Operators

Logical Operators

Bitwise Operators

Assignment Operators


### Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators in C++ are the basic operators, which are used for basic mathematical or arithmetical operations on operands. These operators are essential for performing calculations and manipulating data within a program. There are the following arithmetic operators supported by C++ language,

### Relational Operators:
Relational operators are used to compare two values or expressions. These operators return a boolean value − true if the comparison is correct, and else false. They are essential for making decisions and controlling the flow of a program based on conditions. There are the following relational operators supported by C++ language,

### Logical Operators:
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values (true or false). These operators are essential for controlling the flow of a program based on conditions. There are three primary logical operators in C++ as mentioned below − There are the following logical operators supported by C++ language,

### Bitwise Operators:
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations at the bit level on integer data types. These operations work on direct manipulation of bits, such as low-level programming, graphics, and cryptography.

### Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. These operators allow you to set or update the value stored in a variable.

# Implementation:
In this practical, I have used different types of operators in the following cases,

Positive or Negative number check: This uses the comparison operators which help to identify negative and positive numbers.

Student grade Determination: This uses the mix of Comparison and Logical Operators to allot grades according to the average marks in the 5 subjects.

Quadrant Determination: This also uses the mix of Comparison and Logical Operators to determine the quadrant according to the coordinates, which are entered by the user.

# Conclusion:
I examined various Types of Operators in C++ and gained a deeper understanding of the usage of the operators.
